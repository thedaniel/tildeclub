  <h1>hey remember the web</h1>
  <p>
    I wanted to put my old homepage from 2005 up here, but archive.org doesn't have
    its stylesheets and of course I didn't back it up anywhere that I still have
    access to. I'll come up with something, I promise. I also 'promise' to write out
    all the HTML by hand.
